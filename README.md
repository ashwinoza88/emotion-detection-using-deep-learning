# Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates facial emotion detection using Deep Learning with the FER-2013 dataset. It compares two models: a custom-built CNN for three-class classification and a fine-tuned VGG16 model for seven-class classification. The models were developed by a team of three as part of a deep learning course project at VIT-AP University.

## üìñ Project Brief

This project focuses on facial emotion recognition using grayscale images. Two deep learning models were developed:

1. **Custom DCNN Model** (by Ashwin Oza)  
   - Focused on **3 classes**: `Happy`, `Sad`, and `Neutral`.
   - Utilized a custom CNN architecture with ELU activations, dropout regularization, and batch normalization.
   - Achieved **82.30%** validation accuracy.

2. **Fine-tuned VGG16 Model** (by Musaddiq Ajaz)  
   - Used all **7 emotion classes** from FER-2013.
   - Employed transfer learning using a pre-trained VGG16 model.
   - Achieved **67.93%** validation accuracy.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **FER-2013 Dataset** (available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013))
- Contains 35,887 grayscale 48√ó48 facial expression images categorized into 7 emotions:
  - Angry
  - Disgust
  - Fear
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Surprise
  - Neutral

## üß† Models & Techniques

### üîπ Custom DCNN (3-Class)
- ELU activations, Batch Normalization, Dropout.
- 3 Conv blocks followed by dense layers.
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy  
- Optimizer: Adam

### üîπ Fine-Tuned VGG16 (7-Class)
- Used VGG16 base (from ImageNet), added Global Average Pooling and Dense layers.
- Entire model was fine-tuned.
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy  
- Optimizer: Adam

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

This project consists of two Jupyter Notebooks built and executed using Kaggle Notebook. You can easily run them online using Kaggle's GPU-accelerated environment, or download and open them locally using Jupyter Notebook.

### üìÅ Notebooks

- `FER-2013-DCNN.ipynb`  
  Custom Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for **3-class emotion detection** (`Happy`, `Sad`, `Neutral`). This model focuses on simplicity and accuracy, achieving ~82.30% validation accuracy.

- `FER-2013-VGG16(i).ipynb`  
  Fine-tuned pre-trained **VGG16** model for **7-class classification** using the full FER-2013 dataset (`Angry`, `Disgust`, `Fear`, `Happy`, `Sad`, `Surprise`, `Neutral`). This model leverages transfer learning and deeper feature representations.

### ‚úÖ Run on Kaggle (Recommended)

1. Visit [Kaggle - FER2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and add it to your Kaggle account.
2. Upload the notebooks to your Kaggle account.
3. Set GPU as the accelerator in "Notebook Settings" ‚Üí `Change Runtime Type` ‚Üí GPU.
4. Run each cell sequentially to train and evaluate the models.

### üñ•Ô∏è Run Locally (Optional)

If you prefer running the notebooks locally:

1. Download the `.ipynb` files.
2. Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) and required libraries (`tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
3. Download the FER-2013 dataset and place it in the expected path (as referenced in the code).
4. Open a terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the desired notebook and execute the cells.

üìå **Note:** This project was originally developed and tested entirely on **Kaggle** using their built-in Python environment and GPU backend.
